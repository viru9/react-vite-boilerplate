## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Review the Setup

```bash
cd C:\Users\virajm\react-boilerplate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies (if not done)

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
# Backend API URL (adjust based on your backend setup)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api  # Docker (recommended)
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/v1  # Local development

VITE_API_TIMEOUT=10000
VITE_TOKEN_KEY=auth_token
VITE_REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY=refresh_token
VITE_APP_NAME=My App
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:5173

### 5. Explore the Documentation

All guides are in the `/docs` directory:

- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Understand the project structure
- **FEATURE_CREATION.md** - Learn how to create new features
- **COMPONENT_CREATION.md** - Component patterns and best practices
- **STATE_MANAGEMENT.md** - Redux and React Query usage
- **API_GUIDELINES.md** - API integration patterns
- **TESTING.md** - Testing strategies and examples

## 📝 Available Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run build           # Build for production
npm run preview         # Preview production build

# Code Quality
npm run lint            # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix        # Fix ESLint errors
npm run format          # Format with Prettier
npm run type-check      # TypeScript type checking

# Testing
npm test                # Run tests
npm run test:ui         # Run tests with UI
npm run test:coverage   # Generate coverage report
```

## 🎯 Creating Your First Feature

1. **Copy the example feature:**
   ```bash
   cp -r src/features/example-feature src/features/my-feature
   ```

2. **Update the code:**
   - Define types in `types/index.ts`
   - Create API service in `services/`
   - Add React Query hooks in `hooks/`
   - Build components in `components/`
   - Export in `index.ts`

3. **Add route:**
   Create a page in `src/pages/` and add route in `App.tsx`

See `docs/FEATURE_CREATION.md` for detailed guide.

## 🎨 Key Design Patterns

### State Management Strategy

- **Redux Toolkit** - For client-side state (UI preferences, selections, etc.)
- **React Query** - For server state (API data, caching, background sync)

### Feature-Based Architecture

Each feature is self-contained with its own:
- Components
- Hooks
- Services
- Redux slice (optional)
- Types

### Component Patterns

- shadcn/ui inspired components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
- Accessible by default

## 🔒 Authentication

Complete authentication flow is implemented in `features/auth/`:

- Login/Register forms
- Protected routes
- Token management
- Automatic token refresh
- Redux persistence

## 🧪 Testing

Test utilities are set up in `tests/`:

- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Hook testing
- API mocking with MSW
- Custom render with providers

Example test:
```typescript
import { renderWithProviders, screen } from '@/tests/utils/test-utils';

it('renders component', () => {
  renderWithProviders(<MyComponent />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Hello')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

Build and run with Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .
docker run -p 80:80 my-app
```

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

## 🤝 Customization

Before starting your project:

- [ ] Update `package.json` with your app name
- [ ] Update `README.md` with your project details
- [ ] Configure `.env` with your API endpoints
- [ ] Update `index.html` title and meta tags
- [ ] Replace/modify the example feature
- [ ] Update favicons in `/public`
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for your platform
- [ ] Configure error tracking (Sentry, etc.)

## 💡 Tips

1. **Start with the example feature** - Copy and modify it for new features
2. **Read the documentation** - All patterns are documented in `/docs`
3. **Use the template** - Follow the established patterns for consistency
4. **Type everything** - Take advantage of TypeScript
5. **Test important flows** - Focus on user interactions
6. **Keep features isolated** - Each feature should be independent
